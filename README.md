### Something's not working! What do I do!?
1. Make sure the controller is on port 0 and the joystick is on port 1 in the driver station.
2. If you aren't getting comms, try restarting everything; we've also noticed that connecting to the robot using USB and disconnecting after a while makes stuff work.
3. Make sure you have the latest version of the robot code from this Github repository.
